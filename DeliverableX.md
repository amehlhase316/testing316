### Quality Policy

## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review

**Screen Cast link**: Your link

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

### Sprint Retrospective

> Include your Sprint retrospective here and answer the following questions in an evidence based manner as a team (I do not want each of your individuals opinion here but the team perspective). By evidence-based manner it means I want a Yes or No on each of these questions, and for you to provide evidence for your answer. That is, don’t just say "Yes we did work at a consistent rate because we tried hard"; say "we worked at a consistent rate because here are the following tasks we completed per team member and the rate of commits in our Git logs."

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

**If not, what went wrong?**

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

**Did you deliver business value?**

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

### Contributions:

> In this section I want you to point me to your main contributions (each of you individually). Some of the topcs are not needed for the first deliverables (you should know which things you should have done in this Sprint, if you don't then you have probably missed something):

#### Team member A:
  **Links to GitHub commits with main code contribution (up to 5 links):
  
    - link1
    - link2
  
   **GitHub links to your Unit Tests (up to 3 links):
  
    - link1
